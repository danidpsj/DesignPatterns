# DesignPatterns
This repository keeps examples of the basic programing design patterns that every programmer should know

Each patter example is composed of:
      -Class diagram indicating the example model.
      -A simulation of a certain app whichs uses the specific pattern.
      -A README describing the simulation and the pattern.
      
To execute each example, on each pattern find the class MainSimulator.java, compile and execute it.
Each class diagram has a .uxf editable file and a png version
